# Purpose 🎯

- Remaking ANA with Bootstrap 4 (v.6) markup and styling

# Notes 📝:

- Current layout is just a working sample
- Position of elements are not final, just example
- Colors are not final just a sample
- Components folder is just an easier place to store markup samples/templates for future reference
- As of now, all the components in the right-sidebar are manually assigned a class "mb-4" in order to create space. That will be adjusted later through sass/css
- Ideally, trying to minimize the usage of JS as much as possible to reduce complexity. May need to introduce JS/jQuery over time for specific instances
